# PerformanceTable
table to analyze your public equity long/short positions 


The table is part of a longer project, but the purpose of this specific table is to analyze your results.  The table calculates the time weighted return as well as annualized return for your investment.  FYI: The date you entered the security should be in yyyy/mm/dd format.

Currently the export to excel and export as pdf features are still a work in progress....but, the calculations are accurate. 

The following additiosn are next:
1. Fix export to xlsx and export as PDF features
2. Add a section where you can add how much capital you initially invested so that the table can return porfolio weights for each security invested
